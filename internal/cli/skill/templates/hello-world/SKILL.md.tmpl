# Hello World Template

{{if not .Empty}}
## Overview

This is a comprehensive template skill that demonstrates all the key features and patterns available in the Claude skill system. Use this as a foundation when creating new skills.

This template shows:
- How to structure SKILL.md with clear sections
- Examples of using scripts, references, and assets
- Different workflow patterns (sequential, conditional, task-based)
- Template and example patterns for consistent output
- Best practices for progressive disclosure

## Quick Start

When creating a new skill based on this template:

1. Copy this skill directory and rename it
2. Update the frontmatter (name and description)
3. Replace example content with your domain-specific content
4. Customize or delete resource directories (scripts/, references/, assets/) based on needs
5. Test the skill and iterate

## Workflow Decision Tree

Choose the appropriate workflow based on the user's request:

**Simple demonstration?** → Follow "Hello World Demo" below  
**Learning about scripts?** → Follow "Using Scripts" section  
**Learning about references?** → Follow "Using References" section  
**Learning about assets?** → Follow "Using Assets" section
**Creating a new skill?** → Follow "Skill Development Process" section

## Hello World Demo

This demonstrates a simple workflow pattern.

### Step 1: Greet the User

Execute the greeting script to demonstrate script usage:
```bash
python3 scripts/hello_world.py --name "User"
```

### Step 2: Load Reference Material

If additional context is needed, read the reference documentation:
```bash
cat references/example_guide.md
```

### Step 3: Use Template Assets

Copy the example template from assets/ and customize it:
```bash
cp assets/template.txt output.txt
```

## Using Scripts

Scripts (`scripts/`) contain executable code for deterministic operations.

### When to Use Scripts

- Tasks requiring exact, reproducible results
- Complex algorithms that would be error-prone to rewrite
- Operations requiring specific library versions
- File processing utilities

### Example Script Usage

The included `hello_world.py` demonstrates:
- Command-line argument parsing
- Error handling
- Multiple output formats

Execute with parameters:
```bash
# Basic usage
python3 scripts/hello_world.py --name "World"

# JSON output format
python3 scripts/hello_world.py --name "World" --format json

# With custom message
python3 scripts/hello_world.py --name "World" --message "Welcome"
```

### Script Pattern

Scripts should:
- Include clear docstrings explaining purpose
- Handle errors gracefully
- Accept parameters for flexibility
- Return appropriate exit codes

## Using References

References (`references/`) contain documentation loaded into context when needed.

### When to Use References

- Detailed API documentation
- Database schemas
- Comprehensive workflow guides
- Domain-specific knowledge
- Policy documents

### Example Reference Usage

Read the example guide when detailed information is needed:
```bash
cat references/example_guide.md
```

The guide demonstrates:
- Structured documentation format
- Code examples
- Best practices
- Troubleshooting tips

### Reference Pattern

For large reference files (>10k words), include search guidance in SKILL.md:
```markdown
## Finding Information in References

Use grep to search for specific topics:
- API endpoints: `grep -n "endpoint" references/api_guide.md`
- Error codes: `grep -n "error" references/troubleshooting.md`
```

## Using Assets

Assets (`assets/`) contain files used in final output, not loaded into context.

### When to Use Assets

- Document templates (.docx, .pptx)
- Boilerplate code projects
- Images, logos, icons
- Fonts
- Sample data files

### Example Asset Usage

The included template demonstrates asset usage:
```bash
# Copy template to working directory
cp assets/template.txt my_document.txt

# Customize the template
echo "Custom content here" >> my_document.txt
```

### Asset Pattern

Assets should be:
- Ready-to-use files
- Well-organized by type
- Documented in SKILL.md with usage examples
- Minimal in size (avoid large files when possible)

## Skill Development Process

Follow this workflow when creating new skills:

### 1. Understand Use Cases

Gather concrete examples:
- What will users ask for?
- What functionality is needed?
- What are trigger phrases?

### 2. Plan Resources

Determine what bundled resources will help:
- **Scripts**: What operations are repeated or error-prone?
- **References**: What documentation should Claude reference?
- **Assets**: What files will be used in outputs?

### 3. Choose Structure Pattern

Select the organizational pattern that fits:

**Sequential Workflow** - For step-by-step processes:
```markdown
## Process Overview
1. Step one
2. Step two  
3. Step three

## Step 1: Details
[Instructions]

## Step 2: Details
[Instructions]
```

**Task-Based** - For tool collections:
```markdown
## Quick Start
[Basic usage]

## Task Category 1
[Operations]

## Task Category 2
[Operations]
```

**Reference/Guidelines** - For standards:
```markdown
## Guidelines Overview
[Summary]

## Specification 1
[Details]

## Specification 2
[Details]
```

**Conditional Workflow** - For branching logic:
```markdown
## Decision Point
**Condition A?** → Follow workflow A
**Condition B?** → Follow workflow B

## Workflow A
[Steps]

## Workflow B
[Steps]
```

### 4. Write SKILL.md

Follow these guidelines:

**Frontmatter:**
- `name`: Hyphen-case identifier matching directory name
- `description`: Complete explanation including WHEN to use the skill

**Body:**
- Use imperative/infinitive form ("Run the script" not "Running the script")
- Keep under 500 lines (split into references if longer)
- Provide concrete examples
- Reference bundled resources clearly

### 5. Create Resources

**Scripts:**
- Make executable (`chmod +x`)
- Include usage examples in comments
- Test thoroughly

**References:**
- Structure with clear headers
- Include search patterns for large files
- Avoid duplicating SKILL.md content

**Assets:**
- Keep file sizes reasonable
- Document expected usage
- Organize by type

### 6. Test and Iterate

- Use the skill on real tasks
- Note struggles or inefficiencies
- Update based on usage patterns
- Validate with `quick_validate.py`

## Output Patterns

### Template Pattern

For consistent output format, provide explicit templates:

**Example: Report Structure**
```markdown
# [Title]

## Executive Summary
[One paragraph overview]

## Key Findings
- Finding 1 with data
- Finding 2 with data
- Finding 3 with data

## Recommendations
1. Specific action
2. Specific action
```

### Example Pattern

For style and format guidance, provide input/output examples:

**Example: Code Documentation**

Input: Function that calculates fibonacci numbers
Output:
```python
def fibonacci(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the nth Fibonacci number.
    
    Args:
        n: Position in sequence (0-indexed)
        
    Returns:
        The Fibonacci number at position n
        
    Example:
        >>> fibonacci(6)
        8
    """
```

## Advanced Patterns

### Progressive Disclosure

Keep SKILL.md concise by splitting content:
```markdown
## Basic Usage
[Core instructions]

## Advanced Features
For detailed information, see:
- Form filling: `references/forms.md`
- API reference: `references/api.md`
- Examples: `references/examples.md`
```

### Conditional Resource Loading

Guide Claude to load references based on context:
```markdown
## Working with APIs

For REST APIs, see `references/rest_api.md`  
For GraphQL APIs, see `references/graphql.md`  
For authentication patterns, see `references/auth.md`
```

### Multi-Framework Support

For skills supporting multiple tools/frameworks:
```markdown
## Framework Selection

**Using React?** → See `references/react.md`  
**Using Vue?** → See `references/vue.md`  
**Using Angular?** → See `references/angular.md`
```

## Best Practices

### Conciseness
- Challenge every sentence: "Does Claude really need this?"
- Prefer examples over explanations
- Use references for detailed docs

### Clarity
- Use imperative form
- Provide concrete examples
- Show, don't just tell

### Context Efficiency
- Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines
- Use progressive disclosure
- Load references only when needed

### Completeness
- Document all bundled resources
- Include error handling guidance
- Provide usage examples

## Validation and Packaging

Before distributing the skill:

1. **Validate structure:**
```bash
python3 /mnt/skills/examples/skill-creator/scripts/quick_validate.py /path/to/skill
```

2. **Package for distribution:**
```bash
python3 /mnt/skills/examples/skill-creator/scripts/package_skill.py /path/to/skill
```

The validator checks:
- YAML frontmatter format
- Required fields present
- Naming conventions
- File organization
